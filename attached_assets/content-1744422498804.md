APIs powered by the data of Phish.net. The current API version is `v5`.

All valid requests to the API will begin with [https://api.phish.net/v5](https://api.phish.net/v5).

## Methods

- `artists` \- return artist data
- `attendance` \- return information about show attendance\[1\]
- `jamcharts` \- return jam chart data
- `reviews` \- return data about show reviews\[1\]
- `setlists` \- return setlist data
- `shows` \- return show data
- `songdata` \- return extended song data, including lyrics and history
- `songs` \- return song data
- `users` \- return data about a user
- `venues` \- return venue data

\[1\]: See [special methods](https://docs.phish.net/special-methods)

## API Request Structure

- all data returned via a method: `/[version]/[method].[format]`
- specific row in a method: `/[version]/[method]/[ID].[format]`
- all rows matching a query: `/[version]/[method]/[column]/[value].[format]`

You can effectively "query" for a field using the above. To find a given setlist, you can use _/v5/shows/showdate/YYYY-mm-dd.json_. To get all setlists containing a specific song, _/v5/setlists/song/songname.json_ or better yet _/v5/setlists/slug/url-friendly-song-name.json_.

Be sure to see our [example calls](https://docs.phish.net/examples) for more.

## Authentication

With each request, your API key must be included via either a POST or GET parameter. Data can be passed by URI. Your requests may be rate-limited.

You can [request API keys here](https://phish.net/api/keys/).

## Additional Parameters

Additional parameters may be passed via query string:

- `order_by`: name of column to sort by
- `direction`: direction to sort, either `asc` or `desc` (default `asc`)
- `limit`: number, maximum number of results to return
- `no_header`: if requesting data in _HTML_ format, the argument \_no _header_ will suppress the Phish.net banner
- `callback`: if requesting data in _JSON_ format, sending a callback will wrap the resulting JSON file in a callback function call

e.g., `/[version]/[method]/[column]/[value].[format]?order_by=[column]&direction=[direction]&apikey=[apikey]&callback=my_function`

## Formats

Available formats are JSON (.json) and HTML (.html). Some methods may support XML (.xml).

## Data Storage

Unlike previous versions of our API, local storage is permitted, however, we request that you periodically refresh your data so that you are not presenting users outdated data.

_We highly encourage you to cache frequently accessed data locally_. API usage is tracked and apps that demand too much data, or data too frequently, will be disabled.

Note that Phish.net API response data itself is cached for a short period. If you are looking to embed data from an in-progress show, you will need to use a special method that are forthcoming.

## Attribution and Usage

Use of the API is governed by our [terms of use](https://api.phish.net/keys/).

## Credits

Some parts of the API code use parts of a project called [DB-to-API](https://github.com/project-open-data/db-to-api).
